Plan for my data science pet project on scoring modeling for consumer credits in the banking sector:

* Define the problem and objectives: My goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the creditworthiness of consumers based on various factors such as income, credit history, debt-to-income ratio, employment status, etc.
** Determine what metrics  will  be used to evaluate the model's performance.

* Collect and preprocess the data: collect the data from various sources such as public datasets, credit bureaus, or bank records. 
**  Clean and preprocess it, dealing with missing values, outliers, duplicates, and other issues.
** Transform the data into a suitable format for machine learning, such as numerical or categorical variables.

* Explore and visualize the data: Use descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to gain insights into the data and identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
** This can help to understand the variables that are most relevant to the problem and potential biases or confounding factors.

* Feature engineering and selection: Based on exploratory analysis,  create new features or transform existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model. 
** To select the most informative features using various techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance, or regularization.

* Build and evaluate the model: Choose an appropriate algorithm and train the model using the preprocessed data and the selected features.
** Use cross-validation or other techniques to avoid overfitting and estimate the model's performance on unseen data. 
** Evaluate the model using the chosen metrics and compare it to other models or baselines.

* Test the impact of removing unethical features: Such as race or ethnicity, it is important to ensure that these features do not introduce bias or discrimination into the model.
**  Test the impact of removing these features on the model's performance and fairness, using metrics such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, or calibration.

* Build an uplift model:  build an uplift model to identify which consumers are most likely to benefit from a marketing campaign or an intervention. 
** Uplift modeling can help me measure the incremental effect of a treatment on the outcome, and optimize the targeting of bank resources.


Some additional thoughts:

Using Docker for the database: Idea to use Postgre or No-SQL data base, to increase knowledge of no sql data bases. Postgre is just convinient solution
Retrieving data using web crawlers or synthetic data: Add some additional incformation, as if we bouth data from Telecom. Social Network or QSR
